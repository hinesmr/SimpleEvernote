Simple Evernote - poor man's evernote:

This interface was designed to take *one* *specific* note from your default
notebook and keep it open inside of a textbox permanently. I use it this way
because I don't like separating my notes into many tiny little notes, but I am
rather scatter-brained and I like quick access to a single, massive note which I
can type random ideas into instantly and hit save without having to navigate
across several different buttons or links just to update a single note. I use
this interface inside of a google-gadget, which stays open permanently
throughout the day when I'm at home or work. So, whenever I have a line of text
that I don't want to forget, I can just the idea directly into a pre-opened text
box and followed a quick keystroke to"tab" then "enter" to save immediately.

USAGE:

1. Copy "rename_this_to_prefs.php" to "prefs.php"
2. Edit prefs.php to suite your website and your evernote API key.
3. Point your browser to evernote.php and try it!
